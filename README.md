# NFT Art Galleria

<b>Live Demo: https://virtual-van-gogh.vercel.app/  </b>

There’s a huge push towards NFTs and virtual art that everyone is buzzing about. Even the top art experts agree that this new virtual space for art is going to revolutionize the industry in huge ways. The market for non-fungible tokens surged to $41 billion in 2021, easily comparable to the conventional art market $50 billion in 2020.


```"But how do you appreciate this 'Art'? While in-person galleries aren’t going away, virtual art galleries are the way to go."```

We thought of building building a virtual gallery. virtual galleries are offering people expanded accessibility, incredible digital experiences, and a new way to enjoy fine works and up and coming artists. 

# How we do it
There will be an entry fee to enter the virtual galleria. They can choose among the 3 plans we have right now. You can view various hand picked nfts from the best of the world. The amount spent on seeing each artwork will be recorded. At the end of the visit, your entrance fee will be divided and distributed among the artists. The amount each of the artist recieves will be propotional to the amount of time a user spends looking at their artwork.
